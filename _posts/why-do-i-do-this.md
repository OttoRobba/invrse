#How all my wrong choices helped me

I found myself today thinking of all the things that led me to game development. It wasn't (and isn't) an easy path.

I've always had a complicated relationship with my father and, due to family issues, with money. This pushed me to look for things that were the furthest away from 'regular' and 'normal' because I seldom felt normal.

I felt like I was undeserving of love and of my life, I felt constant guilt, constant pressure to be 'normal' and felt like I was a burden to others. Depression was my company.

Ironically, at the same time, I believed myself to be smarter than others, like I was somehow better than them.

I wanted to isolate myself, to be left to my own devices - as if I always knew best. Even today, I'm mostly a loner and a bit of a misanthrope. 

###Doing art for the sake of being different

In trying not to be normal - because 'normal' is what I thought my family was -  I sought what seemed the least like a normal job.

"Hey, I'm gonna be an artist. Painting is fun and I can work by myself"

I took classes on a myriad of subjects, I attempted to enter the art course in  university without success, I worked with comic books and illustration but only one thing was constant.

###Frustration

It makes me feel stupid (because if I can't do it, then there has to be something wrong with me). With art, frustration was extrapolated a thousand-fold.

"I cost my family all this money, I did all of this and still *I suck*!"

This was not helped by the people clamoring others who had gotten really good once they, you know, stuck to it daily.

"Oh yeah, that guy drew for 12 hours per day"

Bullshit because I knew the guy but hey, he did draw a lot. It always felt like I couldn't find the desire to insist and persist in art. It was consuming me.

###Maybe if I immerse myself or the big doing art in another country

The lowest point, for me, was when I went to live abroad in the US, to study illustration for 3 months. I thought that maybe what I lacked was immersion, free of distractions, surrounded by people who love art.

I never felt so much despair and desperation.

"I'll never make a living out of this, I'm stupid and this is all shit" -- resumes how I felt most days.

I would miss most of the homework assignments, out of guild I would force myself 
to go to class -  in all fairness I loved the storyboarding class. But that was more acting that drawing and I really like acting.
 
The best feeling in the world, though, was when I was riding my bike. Life seemed less important than the wind blowing around me as I went downhill near Colorado Blvd.
 
When I came back, I was changed. I knew in my heart that I did not really want to be an illustrator. It was eating me inside, art was making me miserable, it scared the shit out of me because I no longer felt passion.

I pondered for a while if I ever did.

###That which once made me happy

I started to think of the things I loved the most. There are two that come to mind.

One of them is writing - I've always written, it is how I best express myself. I remember using a typewriter when I was a kid - I loved the hell out of that thing. The sounds it made were like a little symphony that lasted just as long as the time it took to write my ideas. Just like that, the music was gone and only I had heard it, it felt personal

My other great love is gaming. This was bittersweet to think about because I saw it as a vice. I blamed it as the reason why I didn't do many of the things that I wanted to do. But truthfully, I didn't do things when I stopped gaming either. This realization showed me that maybe the problem was elsewhere.

I'll never be able to properly explain how I felt when I played on the Nintendo. There was a whole world within that cartridge, it was akin to magic to me.

It was like a book in which I could be the hero. Not only that, but I could be the hero right next to my friends - so I could be alone but could also enjoy the company of others. Suddenly I was important, I felt meaningful. I was part of  something and, without my actions, that world would never be saved.
 


###Small steps

I thought back to game development. I had tried to make games back when I was twelve but I gave up when I sixteen - had no idea where to go, seemed like a pipe dream. But:

"Maybe I should just suck it up and learn to code - it is the only way I'll ever develop a game"

This single thought defined my entire life from that moment on. I fell in love with programming. It is like prose but for machines - it is all very logical but it has the same tactile feeling from when I type a poem or a letter.

In a way, every line I write feels a bit like a verse that solves a puzzle.

###My happy place

During the 2014's global game jam, I worked mainly as the level designer but I envied my friend who was programming our game. It was in Construct but the juicy logic was  all there. The conditionals, the simplicity masked beneath the sprites that appeared so infinitely complex.
 
I decided that, for the next jam, I would be ready. I wanted to be the team's programmer. And so I studied. Every day. I might not have coded as much as many would recommend but I've always believed in working smart, not hard. I would watch all manner of video related to programming - Python and Ruby conferences, announcements of new languages, how-to guides...

I soon found that this all helped, it worked toward understanding and creating programs. During the 2014's SPJam - the biggest game jam in SÃ£o Paulo - I was *ready*.

I have never been as happy as I was in it. I felt in the zone, I felt incredible. Sure, it is hard work. Yes, it is at times frustrating. But even my wildest desperation didn't drive me away from programming. The will and the love is just bigger than any despair.

###Where to go from now

I want to try and use this blog as a platform to challenge myself and creating a few simple, "tutorial" games. I would like to get into the html5 game market, there are many exciting things going on with javascript right now.
